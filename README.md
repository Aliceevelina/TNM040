# TNM040
UNI COURSE: TNM040 - Communication and User Interfaces, 2019 at LiU.

ODDS ON: A group project made by me, Julia Johnstone, William Hepp, Anders Lundkvist, Victoria Str√•berg och Afra Farkhooy. It was not finished in time for the presentation so the project is not in its final form.

It is a game made for playing in small groups where the app challenges you to do a certain task.

The application is made using React and npm.
